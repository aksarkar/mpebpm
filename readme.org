* Massively Parallel Empirical Bayes Poisson Means 

  This package provides GPU-accelerated inference for the /Empirical Bayes
  Poisson Means/ (EBPM) problem:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    x_ij | s_i lambda_ij ~ Poisson(s_i lambda_ij)
    lambda_ij ~ g_j(lambda_ij)
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  This model can be used to model variation in scRNA-seq data due to
  measurement error, as well as variation in true gene expression values
  ([[https://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.030007][Sarkar and Stephens
  2020]]).

  This implementation readily supports fitting the model for data on the order
  of 10⁶ cells and 10⁴ genes in parallel. It also supports fitting multiple
  EBPM problems per gene in parallel, as arise when e.g., cells have been
  assigned to groups (clusters). For example, we have used the method to solve
  537,678 EBPM problems (54 conditions by 9,957 genes) in parallel in a few
  minutes ([[https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1008045][Sarkar et
  al. 2019]]).
